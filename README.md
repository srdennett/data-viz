# Welcome!

My name is Steven Dennett, and I'm a practitioner/leader in the analytics space, with an interest in data visualization. Currently I manage the Data Science Center of Excellence at NetJets, which includes supporting our Tableau users. You can check out my LinkedIn profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevendennett/) for more of my credentials. I'm using this space on GitHub to organize and share resources and information that other users in the Tableau community may find helpful.
